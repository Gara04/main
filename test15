Here‚Äôs a comprehensive list of SQL (Structured Query Language) topics, which are foundational for working with relational databases, and ideal for certification preparation, mastering database queries, and improving your SQL skills.

üìù 1. SQL Basics
What is SQL? Introduction to relational databases

SQL Syntax: Keywords, Statements, Clauses

SQL Data Types: INT, VARCHAR, DATE, BOOLEAN, etc.

SQL Comments: Single-line and multi-line comments

üîÑ 2. Data Retrieval (Queries)
SELECT Statement: Basic SELECT, * (all columns)

DISTINCT: Removing duplicates

WHERE Clause: Filtering rows with conditions

AND, OR, NOT: Combining conditions

ORDER BY: Sorting results (ASC, DESC)

LIMIT / OFFSET: Limiting the number of rows returned (for pagination)

IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL: Complex conditions

üî¢ 3. Aggregate Functions
COUNT(): Counting rows

SUM(), AVG(): Calculating totals and averages

MIN(), MAX(): Finding minimum and maximum values

GROUP BY: Grouping data by one or more columns

HAVING: Filtering grouped data

COUNT(DISTINCT): Counting distinct values

‚ûï 4. Data Manipulation (DML)
INSERT INTO: Adding new rows to a table

UPDATE: Modifying existing rows

DELETE: Removing rows from a table

TRUNCATE: Removing all rows (without logging individual row deletions)

üîß 5. Data Definition (DDL)
CREATE TABLE: Defining a new table structure

ALTER TABLE: Modifying an existing table (adding/removing columns)

DROP TABLE: Deleting a table

CREATE INDEX: Speeding up data retrieval

DROP INDEX: Removing an index

TRUNCATE: Removing all data from a table (but keeps structure)

üîó 6. Joins and Relationships
INNER JOIN: Returning rows that match in both tables

LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returning all rows from the left table, matched with the right table

RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returning all rows from the right table, matched with the left table

FULL OUTER JOIN: Returning all rows when there is a match in one of the tables

CROSS JOIN: Producing a Cartesian product of two tables

SELF JOIN: Joining a table with itself

üéØ 7. Subqueries
Subquery in SELECT: Using a subquery to filter results

Subquery in WHERE: Using a subquery in the WHERE clause

Subquery in FROM: Using a subquery as a derived table

Correlated Subqueries: Subqueries that reference outer query columns

Exists vs. IN: Checking for the existence of rows

üìë 8. Set Operations
UNION: Combining results of two queries (removes duplicates)

UNION ALL: Combining results of two queries (includes duplicates)

INTERSECT: Returning common records from two queries

EXCEPT: Returning records from the first query that are not in the second

üìÖ 9. Date and Time Functions
CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

DATEADD(), DATEDIFF(): Adding/subtracting dates

EXTRACT(): Extracting parts of a date (year, month, day)

FORMAT(): Formatting date and time

NOW(): Current date and time

DAY(), MONTH(), YEAR(): Extracting date components

üõ†Ô∏è 10. Indexing and Performance
Indexes: Types (unique, composite), creation, advantages, and disadvantages

EXPLAIN: Viewing query execution plans

Query Optimization: Using indexes, avoiding SELECT *, limiting subqueries

Normalization: Breaking down large tables into smaller related ones

Denormalization: Merging tables to reduce joins and improve performance

üîê 11. Constraints and Integrity
PRIMARY KEY: Unique identifier for records in a table

FOREIGN KEY: Ensuring referential integrity between tables

UNIQUE: Ensuring all values in a column are unique

CHECK: Enforcing valid data ranges or conditions

NOT NULL: Ensuring a column does not accept NULL values

DEFAULT: Providing default values for columns

üõ†Ô∏è 12. Transactions
BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK: Starting and controlling transactions

ACID Properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

SAVEPOINT: Setting a savepoint to roll back to a specific point in a transaction

üí° 13. Advanced SQL Features
Stored Procedures: Writing reusable SQL code

Triggers: Automatically executing SQL code in response to events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

Views: Creating virtual tables for simplified queries

User-Defined Functions (UDFs): Custom functions for reusable logic

Temporary Tables: Creating temporary tables for session use

üìà 14. Data Backup & Restoration
BACKUP DATABASE: Creating backups of a database

RESTORE DATABASE: Restoring a database from a backup

üíª 15. SQL Security
GRANT: Giving permissions to users

REVOKE: Removing permissions from users

Roles: Assigning permissions to groups of users

Encryption: Protecting sensitive data at rest and in transit
